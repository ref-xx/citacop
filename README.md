# Citacop
Aka. Convert Image to Amiga Color Palette (and then Save as IFF ILBM) 
By Arda 'ref' Erdikmen

A simple tool to do the actual work.
Citacop is written for OCS Systems. Deluxe Paint, Personal Paint, Amos and other OCS/ESC image viewers will love your exported image files. :D
Citacop exports highly compatible, uncompressed raw ilbm.

Features
🖼️ Color Quantization: Reduce the color depth of images to a specified number of colors.
🎨 Amigafy an Image: Generate Amiga palettes and apply to your image to constrain colors to 4096 amiga colors. (this is not amiga compatible ofcourse-it's for authentic amiga500 look)
✨ Advanced Dithering: Apply ordered dithering (Bayer matrix), Floyd-Steinberg dithering, or no dithering. (dithering is kind of crap but it's what I want actually) :)
📏 Flexible Image Resizing and Cropping: Resize or crop images dynamically with aspect ratio locking.
🔄 Undo/Redo States: Save and revert to previous states for non-destructive editing.
🖌️ Palette Visualization: Preview reduced palettes in a dedicated floating window.
💾 Export Options: Save images in multiple formats, including BMP, JPG, PNG, and Amiga IFF (ILBM).

Supported Platforms
Windows (built with .NET Framework/Windows Forms)
