# Citacop  
**Aka. Convert Image to Amiga Color Palette (and then Save as IFF ILBM)**  
_By Arda 'ref' Erdikmen_

A simple tool to do the actual work.  
Citacop is written for OCS Systems. Deluxe Paint, Personal Paint, Amos, and other OCS/ESC image viewers will love your exported image files. :D  
Citacop exports highly compatible, uncompressed raw ILBM.

## Features  
- 🖼️ **Color Quantization**: Reduce the color depth of images to a specified number of colors.  
- 🎨 **Amigafy an Image**: Generate Amiga palettes and apply them to your image to constrain colors to 4096 Amiga colors (this is not Amiga-compatible, of course—it’s for an authentic Amiga 500 look).  
- ✨ **Advanced Dithering**: Apply ordered dithering (Bayer matrix), Floyd-Steinberg dithering, or no dithering (dithering is kind of crap, but it’s what I want actually 😄).  
- 📏 **Flexible Image Resizing and Cropping**: Resize or crop images dynamically with aspect ratio locking.  
- 🔄 **Undo/Redo States**: Save and revert to previous states for non-destructive editing.  
- 🖌️ **Palette Visualization**: Preview reduced palettes in a dedicated floating window.  
- 💾 **Export Options**: Save images in multiple formats, including BMP, JPG, PNG, and Amiga IFF (ILBM).  

## Supported Platforms  
Windows (built with .NET Framework/Windows Forms)

## How to Use  
1. Load an image into the application.  
2. Select the desired color count, dithering method, and other settings.
